# Terraform Templates for SAP

Terraform Templates for deployment of various SAP Software solution scenarios onto different Hyperscaler Cloud Service Providers and Hypervisors platforms.

These Terraform Templates for SAP are designed to be simple to understand and highly reconfigurable. Each Terraform Template uses the [Terraform Modules for SAP](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/terraform.modules_for_sap).

Project is built of two components:
- Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for deployment of host infrastructure. Uses Terraform.
- Configuration-as-Code (CaC) for configuraton of OS and installation of SAP Software. Uses Ansible, dynamically altered by Terraform.

## Introduction

This project is designed to be outcome-focused and highly-reusable.

Each Terraform Template is for a pre-defined SAP Software solution scenario on a given Infrastructure Platform, e.g. SAP HANA installation to Microsoft Azure, or SAP ECC on HANA System Copy (Homogeneous) to IBM Cloud.

These Terraform Templates are constructed using the custom [Terraform Modules for SAP](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/terraform.modules_for_sap), which can be combined to create new Terraform Templates for different scenarios. **The provided solution scenarios are a baseline, from which amendments and extensions can be made to create any SAP Software solution scenario on any Infrastructure Platform.**

The project addresses common SAP System activities such as:
- initial SAP software installations (Maintenance Planner)
- move or clone SAP Systems to new infrastructure (System Copy)

The project therefore assists SAP-run enterprises to achieve various outcomes, such as:
| Business requirement | Potential activities assisted by this project |
| --- | --- |
| **Migration to SAP S/4HANA AnyPremise:** | **Greenfield**; perform a new installation from SAP Maintenance Planner |
| | **Brownfield**; perform a backup, execute a System Copy (Homogenous) and execute DMO for SUM with System Move, begin testing activities, add to remediation plan, repeat until cutover plan completed |
| | **Selective Data Transition**; perform a backup, execute a System Copy (Homogenous), execute Shell Conversion or Mix&Match, begin testing activities, add to remediation plan, repeat until cutover plan completed |
| **Datacenter Exit / Cloud Service Provider switch:** | **Compute Re-locate**; perform a backup, execute a System Copy (Homogenous) to a target infrastructure, begin testing activities, add to remediation plan, repeat until cutover plan completed |
| | **Compute Re-locate and move to SAP HANA**; perform a backup, execute a System Copy (Homogenous), upgrade ECC EHP and SAP NetWeaver versions, then System Copy (Heterogeneous) using SWPM |
| **Enterprise re-structures:** | **Spin-offs and Divestitures** (Grow through focus on core value); define split-by action *(e.g. Organizational Units such as Company Code, Plants, Controlling area, Profit centers)*, perform a backup, execute a System Copy (Homogenous), perform carve-out activities, begin testing activities, add to remediation plan, repeat until cutover plan completed |
| | **Mergers and Acquisitions** (Grow through expansion); merge of SAP Systems, perform a backup of each, execute a System Copy (Homogenous) of each, upgrade to ECC EHP and SAP NetWeaver versions to match, smoke test functionality of both post-upgrade, begin testing and identification of business process alterations with the corresponding creation of Transports (e.g. altered BC Sets) to manually move |

## Execution workflow structure

Each Terraform Template is for a deployment of a SAP Software solution scenario to a platform, and reuses custom [Terraform Modules for SAP](https://github.com/sap-linuxlab/terraform.modules_for_sap) to provision resources (e.g. host machines) and execute Ansible Playbooks (referencing Ansible Collection Role/s) for configuration of OS and installation of SAP software.

Segregation of definitions for the Infrastructure and SAP Software follows the same delineation:
- Terraform defines the Infrastructure Specification templates
- Ansible defines the SAP Software installation / SAP System templates

An overview of the execution flow is provided in the image below, for full details please see:
- [the Execution Flow documentation](/docs/EXECUTION_FLOW.md)
- [the Infrastructure Platform guidance to use Terraform Templates for SAP](/docs/INFRASTRUCTURE_GUIDANCE.md)

**Future SAP solution scenarios:**

There are various suggested/requested SAP solution scenarios under consideration by the SAP LinuxLab open-source team (across multiple SAP Technology Partners), which have been suggested from customers and SAP Service Partners.

While the Ansible Collections for SAP are compatbile with almost any installation (e.g. SAP SolMan, SAP WebDispatcher, SAP BW/4HANA) - our focus in this project is to provide a common end-to-end automated deployment for common scenarios, therefore we are unable to working code for all combinations. For additional detail, see [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) section.

Any contributors who would are available for development and testing of these proposed future SAP solution scenarios in this project are greatly welcomed, please read the [Contributors document](/docs/CONTRIBUTORS.md). As described in the SAP LinuxLab initiative governance processes, any customer or SAP Partner may submit proposals of new code or direction.

The following list is **`not`** a commitment but is a statement of intent beyond the initial release, the terraform.templates_for_sap project seeks to include in future:

| Proposed future SAP solution scenario | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *SAP HANA multi-node HA/DR installation* | Install of SAP HANA Database Server to multiple virtual machines on a Cloud or Hypervisor, and setup of HA/DR fencing agents and resource agents |
| *SAP HANA multi-node scale-out cluster* installation | Install of SAP HANA Database Server to multiple virtual machines on a Cloud or Hypervisor, and setup of scale-out cluster for OLAP workloads (e.g. SAP BW/4HANA) |
| *SAP S/4HANA distributed installation* | Installation of SAP S/4HANA using SAP HANA Database Server and SAP NetWeaver across multiple virtual machine on a Cloud or Hypervisor |
| *SAP BW/4HANA single-node installation* | Installation of SAP BW/4HANA using SAP HANA Database Server and SAP NetWeaver to a single virtual machine on a Cloud or Hypervisor |

## Requirements, Dependencies and Testing

### SAP User ID credentials

SAP software installation media must be obtained from SAP directly, and requires valid license agreements with SAP in order to access these files.

An SAP Company Number (SCN) contains one or more Installation Number/s, providing licences for specified SAP Software. When an SAP User ID is created within the SAP Customer Number (SCN), the administrator must provide SAP Download authorizations for the SAP User ID.

When an SAP User ID (e.g. S-User) is enabled with and part of an SAP Universal ID, then the `sap_launchpad` Ansible Collection **must** use:
- the SAP User ID
- the password for login with the SAP Universal ID

In addition, if a SAP Universal ID is used then the recommendation is to check and reset the SAP User ID ‘Account Password’ in the [SAP Universal ID Account Manager](https://account.sap.com/manage/accounts), which will help to avoid any potential conflicts.

### Operating System requirements

The execution/controller host of the Terraform Templates must contain:
- Terraform 1.0+
- Ansible Core 2.11+, may work with Ansible 2.9+ but is not fully tested
- git client
- Python 3+ (i.e. CPython distribution)

### Testing on execution/controller host

**Tests with Ansible Core release versions:**
- Ansible Core 2.11.5 community edition

**Tests with Python release versions:**
- Python 3.9.7 (i.e. CPython distribution)

**Tests with Operating System release versions:**
- macOS 11.6 (Big Sur) and 12.3 (Monterey), with Homebrew used for Python 3.x via PyEnv (using iTerm with Bash 5.1 or Terminal with zsh 5.8)
- Windows 10, November 2021 Update (21H2), with Windows Subsystem for Linux v2 (WSL2) and Ubuntu 20.04

## Disclaimer

These are common SAP solution scenarios which are codified using Infrastructure Automation for SAP (Terraform) and Build Automation for SAP (Ansible). These can be extended as needed for bespoke requirements.

This does not intend (and can not) replicate every SAP software deployment scenario, and does not replace any existing SAP installation procedures detailed in the [SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com) or [SAP Notes on SAP ONE Support](https://launchpad.support.sap.com). However, with the Ansible Role for SAP SWPM is possible to install any SAP Software which is supported by SAP Software Provisioning Manager (SWPM 1.0/2.0).

For move-fast activities, such as rapid provisioning and administration testing tasks (latest software releases and revision/patch levels, system copy restore to Cloud etc.), these Terraform Templates for SAP can be amended to suit these requirements.

For greater support in automating the lifecycle of SAP Systems themselves, it is recommended to consider [SAP Landscape Management Enterprise Edition](https://www.sap.com/uk/products/landscape-management.html).

For greater demo and evaluation of SAP Software business functionality, it is recommended to consider [SAP Cloud Appliance Library](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-appliance-library.html).
