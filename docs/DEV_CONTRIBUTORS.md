# New contributors

This project is consistently seeking new contributors, particularly those who are interested in the familiarities and differences of various Infrastructure Platforms.

All Pull Requests are welcomed and will be reviewed for quality. Each review will include an analysis of "commonality" and "modularity", to avoid introducing too many features which are bespoke to an individual Infrastructure Platform and thereby introducing differences in deployments.

The guiding principles and instructions for new contributors is available on the SAP LinuxLab governance page.
